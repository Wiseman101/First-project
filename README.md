** This is my first project on the learning journey of web development. Have written entirely with HTML after deeply learning it. Have practised the concept learnt by building this small project.
The project is about all the html fundamentals inluding basic paragraph tags (<p></p>), headings, lists => Both ordered, unordered, description list, forms, tables, links, images, semantics 
, attributes & values, and multi - page linking.**

** Tested for errors and warnings on W3.org validator and ofcourse i caught them and resolved.
Next stop will be styling this website after again going through deep CSS fundamentals. **
